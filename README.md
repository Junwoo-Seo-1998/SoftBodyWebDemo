# Description
I created a Soft Body Physics Simulation using JavaScript and Three.js, employing the Extended Position Based Dynamics (XPBD) method. This simulation aimed to realistically model the behavior of soft, deformable objects, allowing them to respond naturally to external forces, collisions, and deformations. The XPBD algorithm provided the stability required to maintain the physical integrity of the soft body, ensuring realistic simulations in a real-time environment.
